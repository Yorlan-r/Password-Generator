# Password Generator

## Description

- Javascript is an extremely important aspect of web development.
- I built this project to practice working on Javascript with prompts, variables and functions to generate an outcome from User input.
- This website is now able to generate a password off the users.
- In working on this project i learned the basic functionality off Javascript and how to impliment it into the website to be able to work off the users inputs to generate a random selection between numbers, letters and symbols that i provided for the password generation.
